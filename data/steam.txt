“Hello, I can’t log in to my Steam account on PC because I no longer have the phone number with the Authenticator, and I don’t know what to do. I have 51 games there — any advice?”
“I can't process,” I said when cyber agent Derek Chauvin put his knee on my rear USB charging ports, causing my internal fans to lose their ability to draw in air and cool my motherboard. That caused my motherboard to overheat and reboot my system..
“Loading chunk” errors prevent me from properly browsing store and I can’t access the Steam Deck sale.
“Unsupported hardware“
“We live in the weirdest timeline.”
“You’ve made too many requests recently. Please wait and try tour request again later.”
